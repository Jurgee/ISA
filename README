## Description
This tool focuses on monitoring DHCP traffic and collecting statistics on the utilization of a network prefix based on assigned IP addresses. If the network prefix utilization exceeds 50%, the tool notifies the administrator through standard output and logs the event via a syslog server. This project enables the monitoring of IP address availability in the network and facilitates a prompt response to potential issues.

## Limitations
IPv4 addresses only:
The tool is designed to work exclusively with IPv4 addresses. Support for IPv6 or other address types is not included.

No tunneling support:
Tunneling functionality is not supported in this tool. It operates solely within the constraints of IPv4 networking.

Interface and filename utilizing ncurses:
Both the interface and filename functionalities are built using the ncurses library, providing a streamlined and user-friendly experience.

Exit signal:
To exit the program gracefully, users are required to press Ctrl+C, which sends the interrupt signal for termination.

Prefix of 32 not supported:
The program does not support a prefix length of 32. This limitation is due to considerations related to broadcast and network requirements.

Single subnet range support:
The tool currently supports only the first subnet range. Multiple subnet ranges are not accommodated within the current scope.

## Usage
For usage there is `print_help()` function which prints help message. 

Example of usage with filename:
```
./dhcp-stats -r dhcp.pcapng 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.0.0/22
```
Output:
```
IP-Prefix Max-hosts Allocated addresses Utilization
192.168.1.0/24 254 0 0.00%
192.168.0.0/22 1022 1 0.10%
```
